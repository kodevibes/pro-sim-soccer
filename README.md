## About

Pro Simulation Soccer is a collaborative game project welcoming individuals skilled in game programming (Unreal Engine 5, C++, Blueprints) or game designing. Our aim is to revive the nostalgia of old days' (free & fair) gaming experience. While all players in the game will be free, we'll offer a store for those interested in custom cards, stadiums, kits, articles, etc.

We strive to design multiple modes and diverse gameplay styles catering to all categories. The game will be highly customizable, allowing you to create and add articles to the store, and even use your own server to host competitions, trophies, rewards, and more.

Due to budget constraints as a startup project, we've decided not to utilize real player names, teams, or leagues; everything will be fictitious for the time being.

## Future Modes
We envision the following modes for the game:

* Friendly Match 1vs1: Play against AI or other users, online or offline.
* Challenges: Test your skills in various challenges including Mess, Penalties, Free Kicks, and more.
* Champions: Compete in league tournaments, league cups, Galaxy Cup (4-6 for each league), and become a Supra Champion (1-3 for each league).
* Divisions: Climb the ranks from Division 8 to 1, earning points to advance.
* CO-OP.
* FreeStyle: Showcase your creativity and skills in a freestyle mode.
* Create Your Competition: Have the freedom to design your own competition.
* Edit Team, Player: Customize teams and players to your liking.
* (Other modes to be determined)
